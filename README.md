# Data Mining and Analysis using R Studio
 
This data mining portfolio project involves several tasks related to exploring and analyzing an unknown/unfamiliar dataset. It covers various aspects of data exploration, preprocessing, classification, clustering, and additional insights, demonstrating a comprehensive analysis of the dataset.

The Task breakdown :
## Dataset Exploration and Classification
- Load and View the files, Inspecting the data files, Class distribution, Relationships between and Distribution of attributes
- Combining the two required Data sets
- Classfiers: Two Tree classifers (J48,LMT) and one Instance Based Classifier(Knn)
- Evaluation Method: Cross Validation (3 x 10-fold))
- Comparison of performance of the Algorithms on Training set
- Deeper Comparison of the Algorithms with Training Set
- Testing the dataset
  
## Clustering and Additional Insights
- Preprocess for K-Means
- Decide the number of Clusters - Elbow Method
- Decide the number of clusters - Silhouette Method
- Appling k-means with chosen k=7

## Visualising the Results
- 3D plotting - various principal components
- Cluster sizes - sort clusters by size
- Getting the instances in each cluster

## Naive Bayes
- ONE hot encoding 
- Testing
- Confusion Matrix
